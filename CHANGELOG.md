## Changed
- Configuration of a path to Open MPI is now optional. #17
- `Element` enum is now case-insensitive. #52
- `Input.get_structure()` now adds fragment IDs to the structure with argument `with_fragments`. #34
- HOMO and LUMO getters now keep information about the index and MO channel. #83
- `Output.gbw_json_file()` is now a list of JSON files. #83
- `Calculator` class now does ORCA binary version check by default, but it can be turned off. #112
- Moved create logic in `Output` from `init()` to `parse()`. #116
- If Ruff alters source code then Nox exits with non-zero-status. #126
- `Calculator.write_input()` now returns boolean that says whether an existing input has been overwritten. #124
  - Overwriting existing input can be controlled using `force` argument.
- `Calculator.run()` now returns boolean that indicates whether the ORCA calculation terminated normally. #124
- Allow variable suffixes when creating gbw JSON files. #147
- Calculator.write_input() now delegates formatting to `Input.format_before_coords()` and `Input.format_after_coords()`. #155
- `Output.parse()` now delegates parsing of gbw and property JSON files to `Output.parse_gbw()` and `Output.parse_property()` respectively. #172
- `property_json_file` and `gbw_json_files` are now properties, allowing custom JSON file names to be set via setters. #172 
- Improved typing of the `_orca_environment` decorator using PEP 612 (`ParamSpec` and `Concatenate`), preserving function signatures for IDEs and type checkers. #182
